<br><br>

This is a free Chrome extension to constantly highlight a person by SNILS without using Ctrl+F or searching it manually! 

## `▶️` `Installation`
* Download the archive with source code below or by clicking this button: [`  ⬇️ Download  ` ](https://github.com/anafro/fefu-snils-highlighter/archive/refs/tags/1.1.zip)
* Unpack the source code into a folder
* Open **`chrome://extensions`**
* Turn on the **Developer Mode** by the switch on the top-right corner
* Press **Load unpacked** by clicking the button on the top-left
* Select the folder with source code
* Go to FEFU Admission page: https://www.dvfu.ru/admission/spd/
* Open the extension on the extension bar at the top-right. <sup>_If the extension is not there, press the puzzle button, find the extension, and press the *`📌 Pin`* button_</sup>
* Enter your SNILS code like XXX-XXX-XXX XX
* That's it! You will be always highlighted whenever you visit the admission page!

## `🐛` `Bug Fixes`
* The value of the input where the SNILS should be loaded tries to get the previously entered value from the Chrome Storage. Since it is not defined on the first launch, the input displayed `undefined` right in the input
